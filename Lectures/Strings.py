# String in double or single quotes, prefer double
# strings are ordered sequences
# can use indexing and slicing to grab sub-sections of the string
# indexing notation uses [] after the string (or variable assigned the string)
# indexing allows you to grab a single character from the string

# These actions use square brackets and a number index to indicate positions of what you wish to grab
# Character:    h e l l o
# Index:        0 1 2 3 4 
# Reverse Index:0 -4 -3 -2 -1

# Slicing allows you to grab a subsection of multiple characters, a "slice" of the string.
# Syntax: [start:stop:step]
# start is a numerical index for the slice start
# stop is the index you will go up to (but not include) 
# step is the size of the "jump" you will take

'hello'
"world"
"This is also a string"
"I'm going on a run"
